# Comienzo bbPress #

This is intended to be a clean semantic well documented bbPress theme. I've never seen one that was organized so here is my attempt at building one.

1.0

    * refactored the stock Kakuemi theme to actually have readable code
    * added comments to files to mark out where ids and classes end
    * setup stylesheets and assets to my preferred method
    * added headings and link styles to my liking
